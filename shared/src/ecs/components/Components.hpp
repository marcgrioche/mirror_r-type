/**
 * @deprecated This header file is deprecated and should not be used.
 * All component definitions have been moved to individual header files for better organization.
 * Use the specific component headers instead:
 * - Position.hpp for position components
 * - Velocity.hpp for velocity components
 * - Health.hpp for health components
 * - etc.
 */

// NOTE: This file is deprecated.
// Use individual component headers (Position.hpp, Velocity.hpp, etc.)
